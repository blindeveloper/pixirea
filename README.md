## atomic design
http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/

Main building blocks are:
- Atoms - smallest parts: labels, inputs, btns
- Molecules - are groups of atoms, smallest fundamental units like form groups sections
- Organisms - are groups of molecules joined together like form, header, footer...
- Templates - final design in place, consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together
- Pages - instances of templates where placeholder content is replaced with real representative content
